It defines a layered model that unifies identity, trust, policy\u2011as\u2011code, collaboration controls, and observability so organizations can deploy agents that are verifiably safe, auditable, and compliant. ASTRA standardizes control points where decisions are made, provides an evidence model for audit and forensics, and maps to open standards for identity, policy, and telemetry to ensure portability across platforms. It complements model, data, and prompt security by focusing on runtime decisions and transparent oversight for agent behaviors, tool usage, and agent\u2011to\u2011agent collaboration.

This component addresses one of the most significant challenges in agentic AI security: ensuring that every tool access request is properly authenticated, authorized, and audited without introducing unacceptable latency or complexity.</p> <p>The gateway implements multi-protocol authentication support, seamlessly handling OAuth 2.1 flows [8,9,10] for enterprise integration, mutual TLS for high-security environments, and JWT tokens for lightweight interactions. This flexibility ensures that ASTRA can integrate with existing enterprise authentication infrastructure while supporting the diverse authentication requirements of different agent frameworks and deployment models.</p> <p>A key innovation in the SAG design is its token mediation capability, which prevents the dangerous practice of raw token forwarding. Instead of passing upstream tokens directly to downstream services, the gateway actively exchanges tokens with appropriate resource indicators and scope limitations. This approach prevents privilege escalation attacks and ensures that each service receives only the minimal access tokens required for the specific operation.</p> <p>The gateway's intelligent request routing capability distinguishes between local tools that can be executed directly within the secure environment and external MCP servers that require proxied access.

We achieve this with an OPA server (long\u2011lived evaluator), Redis caching for hot paths, and careful schema design to minimize evaluation complexity while preserving expressiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deterministic Inputs: Canonical, validated schema; no nested input.input   Policies are only as reliable as their inputs. A single, versioned schema\u2014with strict validation and field-level semantics\u2014ensures evaluations are deterministic and safe to optimize.

This enables nuanced allow/deny/escalate outcomes that match enterprise risk posture.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explainability: Always return decision + reason + remediation hint   Developers and auditors must understand why a call was allowed or denied.
