# ASTRA Documentation

## Abstract
ASTRA is a vendor‑neutral reference architecture for securing and governing agentic AI systems in the enterprise. It defines a layered model that unifies identity, trust, policy‑as‑code, collaboration controls, and observability so organizations can deploy agents that are verifiably safe, auditable, and compliant. ASTRA standardizes control points where decisions are made, provides an evidence model for audit and forensics, and maps to open standards for identity, policy, and telemetry to ensure portability across platforms. It complements model, data, and prompt security by focusing on runtime decisions and transparent oversight for agent behaviors, tool usage, and agent‑to‑agent collaboration. The concepts are illustrated with implementation mappings, but the architecture stands independently and is designed to be adopted incrementally.


- **Understand Concepts (RA)**: Start with Sections 1–2, then 5, 8–11, 14.
- **Use ASTRA (IG)**: Start with 15, then 18a checklist, 18b path, 16, 17.
- **Ready to Build?** See Implementation Patterns and Pilot-to-Production.

See Reference Architecture → 5. Architecture overview for the planes model.
