# 2. Current state assessment (background and motivation)
- **Where organizations are today**: pilots and proofs‑of‑concept; limited scope and governance
- **Common security gaps**: no per‑agent identities, broad service accounts, deferred policy, manual/partial audit, weak lineage
- **Why security‑first**: controls are cheapest early and compound with scale; evidence is essential for compliance and incident response
- **Related work (academic anchors)**: Trust Fabric, Zero‑Trust for agentic systems, threat models (ATFAA/SHIELD), TRiSM metrics (include citations list)

#### 2.5 Business value and ROI
- **2.5a Value Framework (timeless methodology)**
  - Cost avoidance categories: compliance violation prevention (regulatory fine avoidance calculation), breach cost mitigation (industry average reference methodology), operational efficiency gains (time‑to‑deployment reduction models)
  - Value realization patterns: security debt prevention (retrofit vs. build‑first cost multipliers), audit preparation (hours saved in compliance prep and evidence collection), risk reduction (quantifiable risk reduction through policy automation)
- **2.5b Current Market Context (updated annually, clearly dated)**
  - Regulatory landscape: current AI governance requirements and penalty structures
  - Industry benchmarks: breach costs, compliance costs, and efficiency metrics (with citation methodology)
  - Technology adoption: policy‑as‑code, observability, and automation adoption rates
- **Companion: ASTRA ROI Calculator** (web‑based tool with current figures)
  - Interactive calculator for cost avoidance, efficiency gains, and risk reduction
  - Updated annually with latest industry data and regulatory requirements
  - Provides organization‑specific ROI projections based on ASTRA adoption scope
