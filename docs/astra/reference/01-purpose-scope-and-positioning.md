# 1. Purpose, scope, and positioning

#### Purpose
Define the first vendor‑neutral reference architecture for the security and governance of agentic AI. ASTRA provides a shared language, control model, and assurance approach so organizations can design, evaluate, and operate agentic systems with predictable risk, clear accountability, and measurable outcomes. It delineates the roles of identity, trust, policy‑as‑code, collaboration controls, and observability, and specifies how these capabilities compose into an enterprise‑ready control plane for agents and their tools.

#### Scope
ASTRA focuses on runtime governance of agent behavior, tool access, agent‑to‑agent collaboration, auditability, and evidence collection. It defines decision inputs (identity, trust, context, risk), expected outcomes (allow, deny, constrain with reasons), and the telemetry and lineage required for transparency and forensics. The architecture intentionally complements—rather than replaces—model, data, and prompt security, and integrates with existing IAM, policy engines, gateways, and monitoring systems already present in enterprise stacks.

#### Positioning
ASTRA sits as a control and assurance layer that is framework‑agnostic and standards‑aligned. It is designed to:
- Integrate with enterprise identity (e.g., OAuth 2.1/OIDC), policy engines (e.g., OPA/Rego), and tool planes (e.g., MCP) without prescribing specific vendors or models.
- Provide clear control points for decisions across agent interactions and collaborations, while remaining complementary to traditional “inside‑out” safeguards on models and data.
- Support incremental adoption: organizations can begin with observability and policy evaluation, and progressively add trust‑aware orchestration, collaboration controls, and compliance evidence over time.
 - Future‑proofing: designed to scale from 1 agent to 100; the same control points, decision model, and evidence structures apply as you grow.

#### 1.5 How to use this document
- **Executives (CIO/CISO):** Read Sections 1–2 for intent and context, then 18 (Adoption & Maturity) and 19 (GRC Mapping) for governance alignment. Optional: skim 8 (Identity, Trust, Attestation) for risk posture.
- **Architects:** Focus on Sections 3–5 (definitions, principles, architecture overview), then 11 (Threat Model) and 14 (Interoperability & Standards). See Appendix F for the detailed layered model and control points.
- **Implementers/Operators:** Use Sections 13 (Deployment & Ops), 15 (Implementation Patterns incl. 15d Anti‑Patterns), 16 (Validation Methodology), 17 (Controls Catalog), and 18a (Pilot‑to‑Production Checklist) for practical rollout and testing.

- Publication structure (for staged release):
  - Part I — Strategic Overview (Sections 1–2, + Business Value & ROI summary, 18, 19)
  - Part II — Architecture Design (Sections 3–5, 11, 14; Section 5 is the consolidated overview; Appendix F for details)
  - Part III — Implementation Guide (Sections 15, 13, 16, 17)
